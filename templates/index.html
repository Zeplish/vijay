        Interleukin (IL)-13 is known to be associated with a number of
        infectious and non-infectious diseases. The fact that several anti-IL-13
        drugs for the possible treatment of asthma and Atopic dermatitis are in
        clinical trials points toward the importance of this cytokine. The
        recent association of IL-13 with COVID-19 severity has sparked interest
        in this cytokine. Therefore prediction and characterization of novel
        molecules which can regulate IL-13 induction might lead to novel
        therapeutics.

        <h4>Some of the features of APPred are as follows:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Predict : </b>This module allows the user to predict whether the
            given peptide(s) have antiprotozoal activity or not.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Design : </b>This module allows the user to generate all the
            possible single mutants of a given peptide and then predict whether
            the mutants have antiprotozoal activity or not.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Protein Scan : </b>This module allows the user to generate all
            the possible overlapping peptides of a given protein sequence and
            determine whether the generated peptides have antiprotozoal activity
            or not.
